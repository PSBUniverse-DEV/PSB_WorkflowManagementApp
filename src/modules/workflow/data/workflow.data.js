/**
 * Client Helpers — workflow.data.js
 *
 * Runs in the browser. Helper functions for your View.
 * NO database calls here — that belongs in workflow.actions.js.
 *
 * WHAT TO PUT HERE:
 *   - Constants (column definitions, tab lists, default values)
 *   - Form builders (createEmptyForm, createFormFromRow)
 *   - Normalizers (trimming strings, converting nulls)
 *   - Display mappers (DB row → table-friendly object)
 *   - Batch helpers (tracking pending creates/updates/deletes)
 *
 * SSO NOTE:
 *   Client-side session data is available via useAuth() hook.
 *   Do NOT store auth tokens or session data here — that's
 *   handled centrally by the SSO cookie (psb_session).
